			<p>Dear <%= dearName %>,</p>
			<p>
				As you know, Apex United Methodist Church is home to a host of
				mission projects from A to Z: our youth <i><b>A</b></i
				>pex Outreach Service Project to our support of global missions
				through <i><b>Z</b></i
				>OE team who empower orphans in Africa & India - as well as our
				support of local food banks, Red Cross, Western Wake Crisis
				Ministry, Feed the Kids, after school tutoring and more!
			</p>
			<p>
				These programs require a small army of volunteers who share their
				time and talents, but these projects also need funding. Our <%=
				nthAnnual %> Annual Art & Gift Market aims to raise these critical
				dollars. In addition to featuring 40+ artist and mission-centered
				booths, our annual event has come to be known for its spectacular
				silent auction.

				Hopefully, this letter will allow you time to consider our request
				and respond by <%= responseDeadline %>. That way you can either
				cheer us on from the sidelines or let us know what we need to do to
				receive any gift you might be able to share at a time/day convenient
				for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are able to support us, please know your donation will be
				part of our online silent auction, which will be open from late
				summer for browsing. The real fun begins on <%= firstBidsDate %>,
				when the first bids come in, and runs through the day of the Market
				on <%= marketDate %>. Please know we are a 501(c)3 [#56-1158859] and
				will joyfully celebrate your donation both online and in-person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you very much for your consideration - and hopefully, your
				donation. Until we hear from you, we wish you every good fortune
				these cooler days of fall have to share.
